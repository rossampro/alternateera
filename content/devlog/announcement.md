# Video Game Announcement

Hello friends! It is I, Ross A.M., _lead singer_ and **producer** of Alternate Era and also a software engineer. My various projects have taken me to new heights and I am excited to share a new project with you!

## Introducing

The Alternate Era video game! This video game will be a 2D 16 bit Metroidvania game based upon the Alternate Era universe and lore that C-Lock and I have spent so much time building. We are so excited to share all of this with you! This game will be a unique experience that you will not forget! Or at least, you won't be able to forget hehehehe.

### Story

You might be wondering what the story behind this game will be. I, too, am wondering the same thing. If only there was some idea I could conjure up inside of my head. Luckily the spirits have communed with me directly, and I have downloaded into my mind the divine will of the eldritch beings.

In _The Final Sound_ you shall play as either Ross A.M. or C-Lock the Watchman as we travel space dimensions looking for ~~drugs~~ _power ups_ to explore the alien worlds even further. We will be traveling through time, fighting monsters (or maybe even other people) all for the goal of bringing back our muse and guide **GYRRGY**.
