Hello friends! It is I, Ross A.M., _lead singer_ and **producer** of Alternate Era and also a software engineer. My various projects have taken me to new heights and I am excited to share a new project with you!

## Introducing

The Alternate Era video game! This video game will be a 2D 16 bit Metroidvania game based upon the Alternate Era universe and lore that C-Lock and I have spent so much time building. We are so excited to share all of this with you! This game will be a unique experience that you will not forget! Or at least, you won't be able to forget hehehehe
