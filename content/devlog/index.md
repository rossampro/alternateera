# Dev Log

Welcome to the Alternate Era Devlog. I, Ross A.M., shall be updating the posts within this page to keep y'all degenerates up to date on the latest news for the upcoming Alternate Era video game **The Final Sound** (Release date: TBD). As you can probably imagine, it takes _a lot of time_ to make a video game, even more so when you are a nerd like myself and choose to use a video game engine that no one has heard about called [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org).

[Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine) is a super cool, data driven, video game engine built entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Which, if you are a nerd like myself, stands out to me for both its performance and memory safety.

> _I still have nightmares about C++ for Unreal Engine, and based on my experience at my last job I never want to touch C# in Unity ever again_
